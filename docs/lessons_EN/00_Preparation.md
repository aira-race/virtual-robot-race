# 0. Preparation

## Introduction
Welcome! In this training, you will learn how to develop AI and rule-based control programs on the virtual robot racing platform "aira."
In this first session, you will set up the development environment you need on your PC.

**Estimated time**: Approx. 10 minutes (excluding download time for Python libraries, etc.)

Work through each step carefully for a smooth start.

## Target Audience

This training is intended for:

*   People interested in AI, autonomous driving, and robot control who want to learn hands-on — university students (3rd year or above) and working professionals.
*   No prior Python programming experience required. However, basic PC skills (typing, copy & paste, running commands in a terminal) are assumed.
*   People who agree to the terms of service for Google's AI services (Gemini Code Assist, etc.) used in this training and can use them with their own accounts (18 years or older recommended).

| **Python** | 3.12 or later (64-bit) | [Official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | **Be sure to check "Add Python to PATH"** |
| **VSCode** | Latest | [Official site](https://code.visualstudio.com/) | Japanese language pack recommended (if needed) |
| **Git** | Latest | [Official site](https://git-scm.com/) | Default settings are fine |

> **⚠️ Most Important**
> If you forget to check "**Add Python to PATH**" during installation, the `python` command will not be recognized and all subsequent steps will fail. If you missed it, uninstall Python and reinstall it.

## 2. Setup Steps
Here are the actual steps. You will build your own personal development environment on your PC.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Own Repository (Fork & Clone)
First, create your own copy (fork) of the official repository, then download (clone) it to your PC.

1.  **Fork**
    - Open the [official repository](https://github.com/AAgrandprix/virtual-robot-race) in your web browser.
    - Click the **Fork** button in the upper right to copy the repository to your GitHub account.
    - This creates your own repository at `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/virtual-robot-race`.

2.  **Clone**
    - Next, download the source code to **your PC**.
    - Open a terminal in any working folder and run the following command, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/virtual-robot-race.git
    ```
    - This creates a `virtual-robot-race` folder on your PC.

### Step 2: Link to the Upstream Repository
Register the original repository as "upstream" so you can easily pull in future updates.

1.  In the terminal, navigate to the project folder you just created.
    ```bash
    cd virtual-robot-race
    ```
2.  Run the following command to register the original repository as `upstream`.
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/AAgrandprix/virtual-robot-race.git
    ```
3.  Verify the configuration.
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
    If you see both `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (the original) as shown below, you are done.
    ```
    origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/virtual-robot-race.git (fetch)
    origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/virtual-robot-race.git (push)
    upstream  https://github.com/AAgrandprix/virtual-robot-race.git (fetch)
    upstream  https://github.com/AAgrandprix/virtual-robot-race.git (push)
    ```

### Step 3: Set Up the Python Environment
Next, set up the Python development environment for controlling the robot.

1.  In the terminal, navigate to the `Project_Beta` folder.
    ```bash
    cd Project_Beta
    ```
2.  Run the setup script `setup_env.bat`.
    ```bash
    .\setup_env.bat
    ```
    This script automatically creates a virtual environment and installs the required Python libraries. When it completes successfully, a new terminal window with the virtual environment activated will open automatically. If you see `(.venv)` at the beginning of the prompt, it worked.

### Step 4: Download the AI Model
Manually download and place the pre-trained model (`model.pth`) used in AI mode.

1.  [Download `model.pth` here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NDL3A2lWDgXdy7OUWctyoR35jtYqthWD/view?usp=sharing).
2.  Copy the downloaded `model.pth` file to **both** of the following folders:
    - `Project_Beta/Robot1/models/model.pth`
    - `Project_Beta/Robot2/models/model.pth`

### Step 5: Configure VS Code
Finally, configure `Visual Studio Code`.

1.  **Open the project folder**
    - Launch VS Code, go to "File" > "Open Folder", and select the `virtual-robot-race/Project_Beta` folder.

2.  **Install recommended extensions**
    - Search for and install the following extensions in the VS Code extensions marketplace:
      - **Python** (by Microsoft): Essential tool for Python development.
      - **Gemini Code Assist** (by Google Cloud): AI-powered coding assistance. You will use this in the latter half of the training. (Sign in with your Google account.)

3.  **Select the Python interpreter**
    - Open the command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P`, then type `Python: Select Interpreter`.
    - Select the project virtual environment `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe`.

    VS Code will now correctly recognize the project's Python environment.

## 3. GPU Acceleration (Optional)
If your PC has an NVIDIA GPU, you can speed up AI training and inference.

1.  Open the virtual environment terminal created by `setup_env.bat` (the one with `(.venv)` at the start of the prompt).
2.  Run the following commands to uninstall the CPU version of PyTorch and install the GPU (CUDA) version.
    ```bash
    pip uninstall torch torchvision -y
    pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
    ```
3.  Check whether the GPU is recognized.
    ```bash
    python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
    ```
    If you see `CUDA available: True`, you are done.

---

## 4. Final Check
Let's do a test run to confirm everything is set up correctly.

1.  Open a new terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + Shift + @`). Confirm that `(.venv)` is shown in the prompt.
2.  Run `main.py`.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3.  Confirm the following:
    - [ ] The Unity simulator **launches automatically**.
    - [ ] Two robots start driving the course automatically (default is rule-based mode).
    - [ ] After the race ends, the `training_data` folder opens and driving data is saved.

4.  Check the saved data. If a folder named `run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` was created inside `Robot1/training_data/`, the data was saved successfully.

Setup is complete! Well done.
Let's move on to the next chapter!
