### 📦 Alpha Version - [`/Project_Alpha`](./Project_Alpha)

The original version with differential drive (tank-style steering):
- Single robot racing
- 4 control modes
- Training data collection
- AI model training

**[→ See Alpha Documentation](./Project_Alpha/README.md)**

## 🚀 Quick Start (Beta)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AAgrandprix/virtual-robot-race.git
cd virtual-robot-race/Project_Beta
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
# Recommended: Python 3.12+
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or simply double-click **`setup_env.bat`** for automatic setup!

### 3. Download AI Model (Optional)
If you want to use AI control mode (MODE_NUM=4):
- [Download model.pth from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NDL3A2lWDgXdy7OUWctyoR35jtYqthWD/view?usp=sharing)
- Place it in `Project_Beta/Robot1/models/model.pth`

### 4. Run the Simulator
```bash
python main.py
```

Unity will auto-launch and the race begins!
