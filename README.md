# Virtual Robot Race

**Race your Algorithm. Challenge the World.**

Educational robot racing simulator with Unity + Python — for learning AI, control algorithms, and autonomous driving.

---

## What is Virtual Robot Race?

Virtual Robot Race is a **beginner-friendly robot simulation environment** where you can:
- Race robots with realistic car physics (torque steer dynamics)
- Train and test AI models using PyTorch
- Compete on the global leaderboard
- Learn autonomous driving through hands-on experimentation

Perfect for students, hobbyists, and AI enthusiasts!

## Current Version

### **Beta 1.5** (Latest) - [`/Project_Beta`](./Project_Beta)

**Released:** 2026-02-08

This version includes:
- Realistic torque steer driving (like a real car, not a tank!)
- 2-robot head-to-head racing with collision penalty system
- Battery management with SOC (State of Charge) simulation
- Global online leaderboard with X (Twitter) integration
- Input Vector Scope visualization
- Offline reinforcement learning framework (DAgger+, AWR)
- 5 control modes: Keyboard, CSV Playback, Rule-Based, Neural Network AI, Smartphone

**[-> Get Started with Beta](./Project_Beta/README.md)**

---

### Alpha Version - [`/Project_Alpha`](./Project_Alpha)

The original version with differential drive (tank-style steering):
- Single robot racing
- 4 control modes
- Training data collection
- AI model training

**[-> See Alpha Documentation](./Project_Alpha/README.md)**

---

## Quick Start (Beta)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AAgrandprix/virtual-robot-race.git
cd virtual-robot-race/Project_Beta
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
# Recommended: Python 3.12+
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or simply double-click **`setup_env.bat`** for automatic setup!

### 3. Download AI Model (Optional)
If you want to use AI control mode (MODE_NUM=4):
- [Download model.pth from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NDL3A2lWDgXdy7OUWctyoR35jtYqthWD/view?usp=sharing)
- Place it in `Project_Beta/Robot1/models/model.pth`

### 4. Run the Simulator
```bash
python main.py
```

Unity will auto-launch and the race begins!

## Features

### Beta Version Highlights
- **Realistic Physics**: Torque steer dynamics based on real car behavior
- **Multiplayer Racing**: Race 2 robots simultaneously
- **Collision Penalty System** (Beta 1.5): SOC-based energy-proportional penalties on collision — AI learns to avoid crashes
- **Battery Management**: SOC simulation with discharge curves and collision penalties
- **Global Leaderboard**: Share your lap times online at [virtualrobotrace.com](https://virtualrobotrace.com)
- **AI Training Pipeline**: Collect data -> Train on Colab/local -> Deploy model
- **Offline Reinforcement Learning** (Beta 1.4): DAgger+ and AWR frameworks for learning from recorded data
- **Input Visualization**: Real-time scope showing drive/steer commands
- **Training Data Tools**: Automatic correction for metadata alignment
- **Cross-Platform Training**: Local PC or Google Colab with GPU

---

## AI Training Workflow

1. **Collect Data**: Drive manually (MODE_NUM=1) with DATA_SAVE=1
2. **Train Model**: Use local GPU or Google Colab
3. **Deploy**: Copy trained model.pth to Robot*/models/
4. **Race**: Run with MODE_NUM=4 (AI control)
5. **Iterate**: Analyze results and improve
